# Output Showcase

## What the Pipeline Produces

This page showcases finished videos that were produced entirely by the Content Pipeline — from trending topic discovery through to the final captioned, branded output.

Each video below went through every stage of the pipeline: topic discovery, script generation, personalization, video production, visual overlays, and captions.

## What to Look For

When reviewing these videos, notice how the pipeline handles each layer:

- **The hook** — How the first few seconds grab attention, tailored to the account's style
- **Presenter + visual transitions** — The seamless alternation between the talking-head avatar and supporting b-roll visuals
- **Logo overlays** — Branded logos appearing at the exact moment an entity is mentioned, each with a context-appropriate animation style
- **Captions** — Word-by-word animated text synced precisely to the narration
- **Voice and tone** — How the account's personality comes through in the delivery

Each of these elements was generated and assembled automatically by the pipeline.
